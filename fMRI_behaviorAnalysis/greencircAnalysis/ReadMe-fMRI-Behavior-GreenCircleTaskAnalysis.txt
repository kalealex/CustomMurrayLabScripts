fMRI Behavioral Data Pipeline


Green Circle Task GABA in ASD

(1) Run the script Create_fMRI_Behavioral_Data_Table_GABAinASD.m. In this script, summary statistics on behavioral performance on the green circle detection task in fMRI are calculated for each scan and each subject. In the process of calculating summary statistics, the script calls the function AK_GABAinASD_BehaviorGreenCirc which parses each .log file (the behavioral data files from the Presentation NBS Software) by, in turn, calling the function AK_GABAinASD_logfileParse.m. The function AK_GABAinASD_BehaviorGreenCirc then calculates hit rate, miss rate, false alarm rate, and d-prime, organizing these statistics into a structure of tables and meta data. Looking at the output of AK_GABAinASD_BehaviorGreenCirc itself is a useful way to check the performance of an individual subject on the fly. The script Create_fMRI_Behavioral_Data_Table_GABAinASD.m organizes these summary statistics into a set of tables which are saved as a .xlsx file at the directory L:\MurrayLab\DataTablesForGUI with the name fMRI_Behavioral_Data_Tables.xlsx. The tables created by this script can be read by the GUI for visualizing eyetracking data (see next step).
(2) Now that you have formatted tables of behavioral summary statistics, you can read them, plot, explore, and export these summary statistics using a single tool: the function AK_GABAinASD_EyeTrackingFiguresGUI.m. Start by running the function. This will immediately bring up a UI window for selecting a data table file to load; select the file from which you'd like to visualize summary statistics. Next you will be looking at a blank figure with UI buttons down the left side of the figure window. Click the Experiments button and choose one or more experiments for which to explore data, realizing that experiments with non-overlapping subjects can not be visualized at the same time. Next click the Statistics button and select the statistics you are interested in plotting. For each statistic, a separate subplot will appear, and within each subplot there will be a cloud of points, each point representing behavioral performance from an individual scan and each cloud of points representing a condition in one of the experiments selected. Each cloud of dots gets its own mean and standard deviation. These plots rely heavily on mouseover labels. As you move your cursor over a cloud of dots the experiment and condition name for that cloud will appear below the x-axis; as you move your cursor over individual points a text box will pop up providing information about subject: session: set/run: block (if these are relevant to your selections). The GUI allows further customization of these plots, allowing you to group participants such that there are two clouds of points for each condition (one per group i.e., ASD vs NT). There is also the option to select a subset of conditions from the experiment selected using the Conditions UI button and to select a subset of subjects from the experiment selected using the Subjects UI button. Additionally, you can filter the data you are looking at so that points that meet a certain criteria will be plotted in a different color (use the Filters UI button to initiate filter selection). For example, if you choose to filter by subjects, points belonging to the selected subset of subjects in the Filter UI menu will appear in a different color from the rest of the subject. You might choose to do this if you are concerned about a particular subject's data across scans and want to see if their fixation behavior is consistently poor. You also have the option to filter points based on another summary statistic, such that points from a scan which meets a given criterion on a given summary statistic will appear in a different color. For example, you might select a filter that plots points in a different color if blink/saccade time was greater than 20% of the data for a scan. You might choose to do this to investigate the relationship between different summary statistics. Lastly, you can export the data corresponding to your current selections by clicking the Export UI button and selecting a directory and file name for the exported data. Note that exported data files will contain a matrix called exportData and a key detailing how metadata variables map onto the dimensions of the exportData matrix. This will enable you to look at, organize, and futher manipulate these summary statistics, say for the purpose of statistical inference, once a given selection has piqued your interest.
